# Self-esteem-body-acceptance-social-networks-and-pornography

For the realization of my final project of the Allwomen bootcamp, I decided to collect my own data. I developed a survey using some existing psychometric tests with consistent validity and reliability and asked some qualitative and quantitative questions regarding social networking behaviors (instagram and tik tok) and consumption and/or exposure to pornographic material.

In the repository are the notebooks of data cleaning, feature engineering, graphic visualization, and analysis of the reflections made by the participants with NLP tools. 

Due to the confidentiality of the survey, I do not attach the datasets. Please, if you are interested in seeing them, do not hesitate to contact me and let me know the purpose so I can provide them to you.
