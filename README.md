# Self-esteem-body-acceptance-social-networks-and-pornography

For the completion of my final project of the Allwomen bootcamp, I decided to collect my own data. I developed a survey using some existing psychometric tests with consistent validity and reliability and asked some qualitative and quantitative questions about social networking behaviors (instagram and tik tok) and consumption and/or exposure to pornographic material. After a week of disseminating the survey, I managed to collect 434 entries. 

In the repository are the notebooks for data cleaning, feature engineering, graphical visualization and analysis of the reflections made by the participants with NLP tools.

Due to the confidentiality of the survey, I am not attaching the datasets. Please, if you are interested in seeing them, do not hesitate to contact me and indicate the purpose so that I can provide them to you.
